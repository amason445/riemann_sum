# Error Analysis of a Riemann Sum

## Summary

Using Python, I wrote a process to calculate a Riemann sum with the midpoint rule given a lower bound, upper bound, an interval count (delta) and an arbitrary lambda function. I then ran an error analysis with an interval count of 5 to 100 on the below function:

$$ x^3 $$
