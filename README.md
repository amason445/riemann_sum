# Error Analysis of a Riemann Sum

## Summary

Using Python, I wrote a process to calculate a Riemann sum with the midpoint rule given a lower bound, upper bound, an interval count (`delta`), and an arbitrary lambda function. I then ran an error analysis on the Riemann sum with an interval count ranging from 5 to 100 on the function $$ x^3 $$.
